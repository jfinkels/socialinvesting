Information is spread out\r\nacross the Web, and much of it is on old and poorly constructed websites. Here\r\nis a collection of information that I have discovered while spending many hours\r\nresearching investments. Please comment if you think I’ve made a mistake or\r\nhave something helpful to add.\r\n\r\n## Investment categories ##\r\n\r\nSocially responsible investments usually include investments in one or more of\r\nthe following categories:\r\n\r\n- **Community development**. Usually these are personal or business loans\r\n  specifically to low- and moderate-income individuals. Some domestic loans in\r\n  this category meet the requirements of the [Community Reinvestment Act\r\n  (CRA)][1], a United States federal law designed to encourage lending\r\n  institutions to provide for the credit needs of people from neighborhoods\r\n  with lower incomes. The organizations Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae\r\n  offer CRA-qualified loans. An individual can buy into mutual funds which are\r\n  a collection of loans such as these.\r\n- **Renewable energy and environmental concerns**. Usually, to invest in this\r\n  category, an individual buys stock in a company which provides products or\r\n  services for renewable energy. One might also buy into a mutual fund, which\r\n  is a collection of many stocks which meet some criteria.\r\n- **Local, organic, and/or sustainable farming**. To invest in this category as\r\n  an individual, one usually needs to find a geographically targeted investment\r\n  fund which provides loans to coops, organic/sustainable farms, etc.\r\n- **Microfinance**. These are investments to very poor individuals or groups\r\n  who might not otherwise be able to receive a traditional loan backed by a\r\n  bank. Unlike the above categories, microfinance investments are usually not\r\n  domestic. An individual can make microfinance investments in several\r\n  ways. One can buy into a social investment fund managed by an institution,\r\n  with a minimum investment on the order of $1000 to $2500. One can also make\r\n  loans using websites which pool smaller investments (on the order of $20 to\r\n  $100) by individuals and provide the sum of those smaller investments to the\r\n  institutions which make the loans. For even finer grained control, there are\r\n  websites which allow individuals to pool small investments to loan money\r\n  directly to individuals.\r\n- **Direct investment in startups**. The [JOBS Act of 2012][2] makes\r\n  crowdfunding for startups possible. Individuals can provide money as startup\r\n  capital directly to new businesses for a share of the profits. This idea is\r\n  similar to the idea behind [Kickstarter][3], [Indiegogo][4], or\r\n  [RocketHub][5], except that projects on these three sites do not return\r\n  profits to the individual who contributes money.\r\n\r\nSome investment funds make investments in several of these categories. Such\r\nfunds are sometimes called \"social investment funds\" or \"community investment\r\nfunds\".\r\n\r\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Reinvestment_Act\r\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JOBS_Act\r\n[3]: http://www.kickstarter.com\r\n[4]: http://www.indiegogo.com\r\n[5]: http://www.rockethub.com\r\n\r\n## How to invest ##\r\n\r\nIn general, one can make socially responsible investments in these categories\r\nby\r\n\r\n* buying into a fund managed by a financial institution which loans to\r\n  individuals,\r\n* buying stock in a socially responsible, publicly-traded company, or\r\n* making smaller investments through microfinance institutions, in \"small\"\r\n  companies, or through loans to individuals.\r\n\r\n## Pros/cons: investing in a managed collection of stocks, bonds, or loans ##\r\n\r\nAdvantages of buying into a fund which makes many loans or investments and\r\nwhich is managed by a team of experts include:\r\n\r\n* a team of experts will do the research on borrowers to determine if they meet\r\n  the socially responsible criteria of the fund\r\n* a team of experts will do the research on borrowers to determine if they are\r\n  likely to repay their loan\r\n* reduced overhead cost of managing multiple loans compared to single loans\r\n\r\nDisadvantages include:\r\n\r\n* smaller risk implies a smaller rate of return, since risk is amortized over\r\n  multiple investments\r\n\r\n## Where to send my money ##\r\n\r\nPublicly traded stocks and bonds and mutual funds consisting of such securities\r\ncan be bought and sold using an online broker. The online broker buys the\r\nstock, bond, or mutual fund on your behalf and provides supplementary\r\ninformation about its current performance, profile, and history.\r\n\r\nTo buy into a social investment fund, one usually must send an application and\r\na check to the institution itself. Such investments cannot be tracked using an\r\nonline broker, as far as I can tell, unless explicitly stated by the fund. For\r\nexample, [Calvert Foundation’s Community Investment Note][6] provides CUSIP\r\nnumbers (which is just a finance term for a universally unique identification\r\nnumber) so that one can purchase the notes through a broker (for example, an\r\nonline broker), but [RSF’s Social Investment Fund][7] does not.\r\n\r\nTo make a microfinance loan or investment through a web service, payments can\r\nbe made directly on the website of the service.\r\n\r\n[6]: http://www.calvertfoundation.org/invest/how-to-invest/offerings\r\n[7]: http://rsfsocialfinance.org/services/investing/social/\r\n\r\n## Return on investment ##\r\n\r\nSome investments, like social investment funds or microfinance investments,\r\nhave a fixed interest rate, usually between 0% and 4%. Others, like stocks or\r\nmutual funds, have variable returns which depend on the economic success of the\r\nproduct or service. In general, socially responsible investments enjoy smaller\r\nprofits when compared with socially irresponsible investments. Also keep in\r\nmind that mutual funds or other collections of securities have smaller risk and\r\ntherefore smaller reward (but smaller losses when a stock tanks).\r\n\r\n## Screening for certain types of investments ##\r\n\r\nMutual funds may explicitly state the types of companies in which they invest\r\nand those in which they do not invest. Active investment in a certain type of\r\ncompany is called \"positive screening\", and active non-investment in a certain\r\ntype of company is called \"negative screening\". The United States Social\r\nInvestment Forum (US SIF) has done the research on many popular mutual funds\r\ndesigned for socially responsible investment to determine their screening\r\npractices. The chart can be found [here][8].\r\n\r\n[8]: http://ussif.org/resources/mfpc/screening.cfm\r\n\r\n## Where to find investments ##\r\n\r\nIn this section, I provide some links to websites I have found helpful, plus\r\nsome suggestions for investment opportunities which, according to my amateur\r\nresearch, seem legitimate.\r\n\r\nThe following websites list social investment funds:\r\n\r\n* [Slow Money][9]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following social investment funds seem reasonably successful:\r\n\r\n* [RSF Social Investment Fund][6]\r\n* [Calvert Foundation Community Investment Note][7]\r\n\r\nThe following websites list socially responsible mutual funds:\r\n\r\n* [United States Social Investment Forum][8]\r\n\r\nThe following socially responsible mutual funds seem reasonably successful:\r\n\r\n* [New Alternatives Fund][10] ([NALFX][11])\r\n* [CRA Qualified Investment Fund][12] ([CRATX][13])\r\n\r\nThe following websites allow individuals to fund microfinance loans with small\r\namounts of money:\r\n\r\n* [Kiva][14]. These are charitable loans which backfill loans made by\r\n  microfinance institutions, and *do not provide income* due to interest. Note\r\n  that money paid does not go directly to the person whose face is above the\r\n  \"Lend now\" button.\r\n* [Microplace][15]. These are investments which fund microfinance institutions\r\n  to make specific types of loans.\r\n* [Zidisha][16]. These are loans made by a group of lenders (you and other\r\n  individuals) directly to borrowing individuals without any intermediary\r\n  microfinance institution (besides the website itself).\r\n\r\nThe following website allows individuals to fund startups with small amounts of\r\nmoney:\r\n\r\n* [Wefunder][17]. This site will (after the SEC concludes its rulemaking period\r\n  for the JOBS Act, which should conclude approximately in January, 2013) allow\r\n  individuals to invest some \"small\" amount of money into startups (on the\r\n  order of $1000).\r\n\r\n[9]: http://slowmoney.org/invest\r\n[10]: http://www.newalternativesfund.com/\r\n[11]: https://www.google.com/finance?q=MUTF:NALFX\r\n[12]: http://www.ccmfixedincome.com/individual.php?category=Mutual-Fund\r\n[13]: https://www.google.com/finance?q=MUTF:CRATX\r\n[14]: https://www.kiva.org\r\n[15]: https://www.microplace.com\r\n[16]: https://www.zidisha.org\r\n[17]: https://www.wefunder.com\r\n","tagline":"Notes on socially responsible investing for the confused young investor.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
