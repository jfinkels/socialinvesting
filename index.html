<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Socially responsible investing is confusing to me. Information is spread out
across the Web, and much of it is on old and poorly constructed websites. Here
is a collection of information that I have discovered while spending many hours
researching investments. Please comment if you think I’ve made a mistake or
have something helpful to add.</p>

<h2>Investment categories</h2>

<p>Socially responsible investments usually include investments in one or more of
the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Community development</strong>. Usually these are personal or business loans
specifically to low- and moderate-income individuals. Some domestic loans in
this category meet the requirements of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Reinvestment_Act">Community Reinvestment Act
(CRA)</a>, a United States federal law designed to encourage lending
institutions to provide for the credit needs of people from neighborhoods
with lower incomes. The organizations Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae
offer CRA-qualified loans. An individual can buy into mutual funds which are
a collection of loans such as these.</li>
<li>
<strong>Renewable energy and environmental concerns</strong>. Usually, to invest in this
category, an individual buys stock in a company which provides products or
services for renewable energy. One might also buy into a mutual fund, which
is a collection of many stocks which meet some criteria.</li>
<li>
<strong>Local, organic, and/or sustainable farming</strong>. To invest in this category as
an individual, one usually needs to find a geographically targeted investment
fund which provides loans to coops, organic/sustainable farms, etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Microfinance</strong>. These are investments to very poor individuals or groups
who might not otherwise be able to receive a traditional loan backed by a
bank. Unlike the above categories, microfinance investments are usually not
domestic. An individual can make microfinance investments in several
ways. One can buy into a social investment fund managed by an institution,
with a minimum investment on the order of $1000 to $2500. One can also make
loans using websites which pool smaller investments (on the order of $20 to
$100) by individuals and provide the sum of those smaller investments to the
institutions which make the loans. For even finer grained control, there are
websites which allow individuals to pool small investments to loan money
directly to individuals.</li>
<li>
<strong>Direct investment in startups</strong>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JOBS_Act">JOBS Act of 2012</a> makes
crowdfunding for startups possible. Individuals can provide money as startup
capital directly to new businesses for a share of the profits. This idea is
similar to the idea behind <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a>, <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com">Indiegogo</a>, or
<a href="http://www.rockethub.com">RocketHub</a>, except that projects on these three sites do not return
profits to the individual who contributes money.</li>
</ul><p>Some investment funds make investments in several of these categories. Such
funds are sometimes called "social investment funds" or "community investment
funds".</p>

<h2>How to invest</h2>

<p>In general, one can make socially responsible investments in these categories
by</p>

<ul>
<li>buying into a fund managed by a financial institution which loans to
individuals,</li>
<li>buying stock in a socially responsible, publicly-traded company, or</li>
<li>making smaller investments through microfinance institutions, in "small"
companies, or through loans to individuals.</li>
</ul><h2>Advantages and disadvantages of investing in a managed collection of stocks, bonds, or loans</h2>

<p>Advantages of buying into a fund which makes many loans or investments and
which is managed by a team of experts include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a team of experts will do the research on borrowers to determine if they meet
the socially responsible criteria of the fund</li>
<li>a team of experts will do the research on borrowers to determine if they are
likely to repay their loan</li>
<li>reduced overhead cost of managing multiple loans compared to single loans</li>
</ul><p>Disadvantages include:</p>

<ul>
<li>smaller risk implies a smaller rate of return, since risk is amortized over
multiple investments</li>
</ul><h2>Where to send my money</h2>

<p>Publicly traded stocks and bonds and mutual funds consisting of such securities
can be bought and sold using an online broker. The online broker buys the
stock, bond, or mutual fund on your behalf and provides supplementary
information about its current performance, profile, and history.</p>

<p>To buy into a social investment fund, one usually must send an application and
a check to the institution itself. Such investments cannot be tracked using an
online broker, as far as I can tell, unless explicitly stated by the fund. For
example, <a href="http://www.calvertfoundation.org/invest/how-to-invest/offerings">Calvert Foundation’s Community Investment Note</a> provides CUSIP
numbers (which is just a finance term for a universally unique identification
number) so that one can purchase the notes through a broker (for example, an
online broker), but <a href="http://rsfsocialfinance.org/services/investing/social/">RSF’s Social Investment Fund</a> does not.</p>

<p>To make a microfinance loan or investment through a web service, payments can
be made directly on the website of the service.</p>

<h2>Return on investment</h2>

<p>Some investments, like social investment funds or microfinance investments,
have a fixed interest rate, usually between 0% and 4%. Others, like stocks or
mutual funds, have variable returns which depend on the economic success of the
product or service. In general, socially responsible investments enjoy smaller
profits when compared with socially irresponsible investments. Also keep in
mind that mutual funds or other collections of securities have smaller risk and
therefore smaller reward (but smaller losses when a stock tanks).</p>

<h2>Screening for certain types of investments</h2>

<p>Mutual funds may explicitly state the types of companies in which they invest
and those in which they do not invest. Active investment in a certain type of
company is called "positive screening", and active non-investment in a certain
type of company is called "negative screening". The United States Social
Investment Forum (US SIF) has done the research on many popular mutual funds
designed for socially responsible investment to determine their screening
practices. The chart can be found <a href="http://ussif.org/resources/mfpc/screening.cfm">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Where to find investments</h2>

<p>In this section, I provide some links to websites I have found helpful, plus
some suggestions for investment opportunities which, according to my amateur
research, seem legitimate.</p>

amounts of money:</p>

<ul>

<a href="https://www.kiva.org">Kiva</a>. These are charitable loans which backfill loans made by
microfinance institutions, and <em>do not provide income</em> due to interest. Note
that money paid does not go directly to the person whose face is above the
"Lend now" button.</li>

<a href="https://www.microplace.com">Microplace</a>. These are investments which fund microfinance institutions
to make specific types of loans.</li>

individuals) directly to borrowing individuals without any intermediary
microfinance institution (besides the website itself).</li>
</ul>

money:</p>

for the JOBS Act, which should conclude approximately in January, 2013) allow
individuals to invest some "small" amount of money into startups (on the
order of $1000).</li>

computer games.</li>
</ul>
